    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      From our analysis, we can see that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Females perform better than males on average.
        </li>
        <li>
          As parental education level becomes higher, the averages scores also increase for
           both males and females
        </li>
        <li>
          Students who received free or reduced lunches performed worse on average than those
           who did not, for both males and females.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students who undertook test preparation performed better on average than those
           who did not, for both males and females.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Consequently, we should aim to provide more economic support to those students who receive
      free or reduced lunches and try to ensure everyone has adequate test preparation help.

    <h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>
      Clearly, this is only a very brief, surface-level anaylsis of the data and so there are 
      many more avenues which we can walk down to try and retrieve insights. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Considering a socioeconomic score, by using a weighted average formula for the 
          socioeconomic influences we identified.
        </li>
        <li>
          The dataset also included a field on racial ethnicity, therefore taking this 
          into account could provide some more insights.
        </li>
        <li>
          Visualising the data using Python, for example.
        </li>
      </ul>
