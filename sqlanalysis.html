    <h2>Analysing Performance by Gender</h2>
    <p>We start off our analysis by creating 2 new tables, using the code below,
       from our original table, so that we can seperate the scores of men and women.
      <div class="sql-box">
        create table men_all_scores select * from all_scores where gender = 1;
        create table women_all_scores select * from all_scores where gender = 0;
      </div>
      Next, using basic aggregate functions we can obtain some metrics.
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2">Genders</th>
            <th colspan="4">Maximum</th>
            <th colspan="4">Minimum</th>
            <th colspan="4">Average</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <th>Maths Score</th>
            <th>Reading Score</th>
            <th>Writing Score</th>
            <th>Combined Score</th>
            <th>Maths Score</th>
            <th>Reading Score</th>
            <th>Writing Score</th>
            <th>Combined Score</th>
            <th>Maths Score</th>
            <th>Reading Score</th>
            <th>Writing Score</th>
            <th>Combined Score</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Male</td>
            <td>100</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>300</td>
            <td>27</td><td>23</td><td>15</td><td>69</td>
            <td>68.7</td><td>65.5</td><td>63.3</td><td>197.5</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>100</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>300</td>
            <td>0</td><td>17</td><td>10</td><td>27</td>
            <td>63.6</td><td>72.6</td><td>72.5</td><td>208.7</td>
        </tr>
    </table> 
    The minimum section of this table stands out because we see a large difference between the men and women, 
    namely the minimum maths and combined scores. However, this difference seems to be balanced out when looking 
    at the averages; in fact females have a higher combined average score than males. Furthermore, we can also 
    average the combined averages across the 3 subjects for both males and females, to obtain an average score of 65.8
    for a typical male in any of the 3 subjects and the analgous score for females is 69.6.

    <h2>Socio-economical influences</h2>

    <p>
      This dataset contains information regarding the educational background of the student's family, 
      whether students receive a free or reduced lunch and whether students completed a test prep course.
      
      <h3>Parental education level</h3>
      Using the <code class="language-sql">GROUP BY</code> statement, we can firstly analyse the average scores based on
      the educational background of the student's family. N.B. the scores in the tables below are all <b>average</b> scores
      and the combined average score is averaged across the 3 subjects as well.

        </tr>
      </table>
      From these tables we can see that as the education level of a student's parents increases, we can expect their average
      scores to also increase.
      
      <h3>Free or reduced lunch</h3>
      We now take a similar approach to the next socio-economic influence - whether students receive a free or reduced lunch.
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2">Genders</th>
            <th colspan="4">Recieved free/reduced lunch</th>
            <th colspan="4">No free/reduced lunch</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <th>Maths Score</th>
            <th>Reading Score</th>
            <th>Writing Score</th>
            <th>Combined Score</th>
            <th>Maths Score</th>
            <th>Reading Score</th>
            <th>Writing Score</th>
            <th>Combined Score</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Male</td>
            <td>62.5</td><td>61.5</td><td>59.1</td><td>61.0</td>
            <td>72.0</td><td>67.5</td><td>65.5</td><td>68.4</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>55.8</td><td>67.4</td><td>66.4</td><td>63.2</td>
            <td>68.1</td><td>75.6</td><td>75.9</td><td>73.2</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      Using these tables, we can see that students have receive free or reduced lunches score lower than those who do not.

      <h3>Test prep course</h3>
      Finally, we take the same approach to the final social-economic influence - whether students completed a test prep 
      course.

      <table>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2">Genders</th>
            <th colspan="4">Recieved test prep</th>
            <th colspan="4">No test prep</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <th>Maths Score</th>
            <th>Reading Score</th>
            <th>Writing Score</th>
            <th>Combined Score</th>
            <th>Maths Score</th>
            <th>Reading Score</th>
            <th>Writing Score</th>
            <th>Combined Score</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Male</td>
            <td>72.3</td><td>70.2</td><td>69.8</td><td>70.8</td>
            <td>66.7</td><td>62.8</td><td>59.6</td><td>63.0</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>67.2</td><td>77.4</td><td>78.8</td><td>74.5</td>
            <td>61.7</td><td>70.0</td><td>69.0</td><td>66.9</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      We can see that students who had the extra preparation typically had higher average scores, as we would expect.

      Now that we have completed our analysis, we can conclude: <a href="conclusion.html">Conclusion</a>.
